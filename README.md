Nobody is a good developer when they first start learning how to program. Such was the case when I started.

In a quick attempt to get a job, I borrowed a basic HTML structure from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) and slapped my information on the page.

Since then, I haven't touched it.

I've always wanted a website that was my own. Thus was born Portfolio V2. 

Completely designed by me with some help from some very talented, open-source talents (credit given on my site and here in the ReadMe).
As well as completely updated information and some new features. I also plan on learning from my past mistakes and maintaining this website regularly.

## Bugs
If you notice any bugs or issues with my website, please feel free to report the issue [via GitHub](https://github.com/tygedavis/portfolio-v2/issues) or let me know [here](https://github.com/tygedavis/portfolio-v2/discussions) in this repositories discussion page.
